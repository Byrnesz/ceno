# Introduction to CENO

The [Censorship.no!](https://censorship.no) project (CENO) works by exfiltrating
website requests out of a censored area using an anonymous transport layer,
[bundling](https://github.com/equalitie/bundler) websites into files and
inserting them into encrypted distributed storage networks. For the user the
experience is more or less transparent, accessing CENO content through a portal
in the browser.

CENO currently bridges the [Freenet](https://freenetproject.org) anonymity
network with the mainstream Internet, benefiting from the networkâ€™s
circumvention properties and thousands of existing nodes. CENO uses Freenet
nodes to cache imported content inside the target country, using the (less
throttled) national network infrastructure for anonymous distribution amongst
other nodes.
