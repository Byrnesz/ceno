{{define "OVERLAY"}}
<!--
  In order to add more text to the overlay, edit portal/locale/en.json to add a new key and string.
  In order for the portal client-side javascript to be able to automatically detect the new paragraph,
  you must give the key a name like "overlayParagraphN" where N can be 1,2,3,4,5,...,10,11,...100, etc.
  Just make sure to get the casing right. Lower-case 'o' in overlay, uppercase 'P' in Paragraph.
  Once you've added the new key and corresponding English string to en.json, come back to this file
  and create a new <p> tag just like the ones below and set the "id" to the key you set.

  Note that you must add paragraphs with increasing numbers, counting by 1.  If you only have
  overlayParagraphs 1 through 4 and suddenly add 6, 0, 10, or anything other than 5, the client-side
  code will not be able to detect it.  Also, make sure you add commas in the right places in en.json.

  Note also that you do not have to paste the text in here.  The client-side javascript code will
  automatically fill it in when the portal page is rendered.
