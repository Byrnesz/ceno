# Reporting Errors

CeNo is designed to handle errors and misconfiguration issues as gracefully as possible, but from time to time,
something will happen that could not be perfectly anticipated and recovered from.  In such cases you will be presented
with an error page upon requesting a document from the web.  Before reporting your error to the developers, you should
try to troubleshoot the problem in reference to the **Handling Errors** section of this document.

In the case that an error that CeNo cannot recover from on its own occurs, you will be presented with a message
instructing you that it may be worthwhile to contact the developers.  If this is the case, or there is an issue you have
encountered and cannot find a solution for, you can report issues using either of the following methods:

1. Create an issue ticket on the [public issue tracker](https://github.com/equalitie/ceno/issues). This will require
that you possess and use a Github account, however it will give your problem more visibility and open up a space for
other users and developers to discuss the issue and collaborate to find a solution.
2. You can also email either or both of CeNo's primary developers. The public keys for both are available in the
`/resources` directory of your distribution (and the repository) if you would like to use PGP to encrypt your email.

  * Prometheas   - prometheas@autistici.org

Whether you publish a new issue or send an email, please try to be as clear and specific about your issue as possible.
Some useful information to include in your report:

1. The website/page you were attempting to visit
2. Your browser's proxy configuration
3. Your client configuration
