# CENO Freenet Plugin

CENO Freenet plugin is an interface between CENO node and Freenet.

It helps a CENO node to use Freeenet both as a cache storage and a communication network, 
while keeping the implementation of CENO node proper independent of the underlying caching
and communication infrastructure.

## Building

Instructions for building and running the Freenet plugin components can be
found in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/equalitie/ceno/blob/master/ceno-freenet/INSTALL.md)
and [INSTALL.Bridge.md](https://github.com/equalitie/ceno/blob/master/ceno-freenet/INSTALL.Bridge.md)
as well as [README.Building.md](https://github.com/equalitie/ceno/blob/master/ceno-freenet/README.building.md)
