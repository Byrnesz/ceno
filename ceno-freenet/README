CeNo! Freenet Plugin
====================

CeNo! Freenet plugin is an interface between CeNo! node and Freenet.

It helps a CeNo! node to use Freeenet both as a cache storage and a communication network, while keeping the implementation of CeNo! node proper independent of the underlying caching and communication infrastructure.
